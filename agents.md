# AGENTS.md

## Project
Simple static website (HTML/CSS/JS). For now unless super necessary are you make explicit full explanations etc

## Rules
- Make small changes: max 1–3 files per task.more only if necessary to everyting
- Do not rename files or restructure folders unless I ask.
- Do not add dependencies unless I ask.
- Keep the current style and formatting.

## When you change code
- Explain in simple English:
  - what you changed
  - where you changed it
  - why you changed it
  - also if i need to add anyhting like if were using an api key prompt me to place that somewhere etc

## Output
- Prefer a unified diff patch or a PR-ready change list.
- If you open a PR, include a short "How to test" section.
