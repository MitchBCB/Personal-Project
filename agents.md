# AGENTS.md

## Project
Simple static website (HTML/CSS/JS). No frameworks.

## Rules
- Make small changes: max 1–3 files per task.
- Do not rename files or restructure folders unless I ask.
- Do not add dependencies unless I ask.
- Keep the current style and formatting.

## When you change code
- Explain in simple English:
  - what you changed
  - where you changed it
  - why you changed it

## Output
- Prefer a unified diff patch or a PR-ready change list.
- If you open a PR, include a short "How to test" section.
